# Deployment Instructions

## Manual Netlify Deployment

Since we're in a Docker environment and can't authenticate with Netlify CLI directly, here are the steps to deploy your fraud detection dashboard manually:

### Option 1: Drag & Drop Deployment

1. **Build Complete**: The application has been built successfully in the `dist/` folder
2. **Go to Netlify**: Visit [https://app.netlify.com/](https://app.netlify.com/)
3. **Sign in/Sign up**: Create a Netlify account if you don't have one
4. **Deploy**: 
   - Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Drag and drop the entire `dist/` folder onto the deployment area
   - Or upload the `dist.tar.gz` file we created

### Option 2: Git-based Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub**: Push this project to a GitHub repository
2. **Connect to Netlify**: 
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select this repository
3. **Build Settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `18`

### Option 3: Netlify CLI (when you have browser access)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify (opens browser)
netlify login

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## Configuration Files

The following files are already configured for optimal Netlify deployment:

- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration with redirects and headers
- `dist/` folder - Built application ready for deployment
- `dist.tar.gz` - Compressed archive for easy upload

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, your fraud detection dashboard will be available at a Netlify URL (e.g., `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`).

### Custom Domain (Optional)
